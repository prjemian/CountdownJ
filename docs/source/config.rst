      Basic screen provides controls to add time to the current or next presentation.
      
      Other buttons are intuitive: *Start* and *Clear*.  Once the timer has started,
      *Start* changes to *Pause*.  When paused, *Pause* changes to *Resume*.
      
      Tabs access *Presets* (preset talk lengths) and *other* controls (*Configure* and *About*).
